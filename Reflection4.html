I especially learned that attention to detail is the key so a successful code in JavaScript. Speaking of attention to detail, it does not only apply to coding 
but in our daily lives as well. 
Paying attention to the smallest of things could make a big difference.  JavaScript, like many programming languages, 
really teaches you how important every little detail is. Even small syntax mistakes, 
like a missing semicolon or a misplaced bracket, can cause code to fail or behave unexpectedly.</p></font></th>
