For this quarter I learned a handfull and more about CSS. Cascading Style Sheets, though difficult to navigate at first, once understood it is easy to use. I learned how to insert images and format them to a certain style. I learned how to use a CSS file and more.
 I cannot confidently say that I have truly grasped the full potential of CSS but I am satisfied and happy that I was able to execute activities that included it. I hope to leanr alot more in ICT. Especially regarding coding since it is fun when you start to understand it. CSS has been a rollercoaster of a ride to grasp, but towards the end I started to understand it. Im most proud of this website since I used CSS coding to create it. I managed to excute it well, and I hope to learn more insightful things for the next two quarters of Grade 9.
